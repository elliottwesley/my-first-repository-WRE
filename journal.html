  <h1>piJournal</h1>
  <p>This webpage is a journal for chronicling my exploration of the Raspberry Pi.</p>
  <h3>31 January 2019</h3>
  <p>Assignment revealed.  We were to load an operating system on a Raspberry Pi computer and <br />
  begin to explore its capabilities. As I have already had experence from last semester, I wanted <br />
  to seek out a different OS from the two I've already used: Raspbian, a Debian-based OS designed <br />
  specifically for the Raspberry Pi, and ubuntuMATE, version 16.04 (Xenial Xerus), optimized and <br />
  ported for use on a Raspberry Pi computer.  After a quick search on Distro Watch, I selected <br />
  Tiny Core Linux to be my next OS to explore. According to its entry on Distro Watch, it is <br />
  12 megabytes in size and based on Damn Small Linux (DSL), another ultra-lightweight Linux <br />
  operating system that was developed over a decade ago and has long since been discontinued. <br />
  We were recommended to procure our own microSD cards.</p>
  <h3>4 February</h3>
  <p>I loaded Tiny Core (specifically piCore) onto my microSD and began to tinker with it.  Booting <br />
  takes the user to a command-line interface awaiting typed commands.  The README from the Tiny <br /> 
  Core website provides instructions for what to do, but to me it felt as if I was learning command-line <br />
  all over again.  This fact alone tells me that Tiny Core would not be an ideal first choice for <br />
  someone who has never used a Linux operating system before, let alone command-line.  I will attempt <br />
  to rewrite partitions on the card again next class in hopes of creating a fully functional computer.</p>

  <h3>7 February 2019</h3>
  <p>I attempted again to properly partition the microSD.  This time, however, the partitions appeared <br />
  to be out of order this time. I did figure out how to partition (it's easier than it looks), <br />
  but I couldn't complete step 4 of partitioning according to the README.  I will wipe and reload <br />
  the MicroSD and try again later. </p>

  <p>Copy/pasted from my typed notes sheet.  Forgive the mess.</p>
  <p>Wiped and Reloaded SD card AGAIN.  Booted.</p>
  <p>Command:  sudo fdisk -u /dev/mmcblk0</p>
  <p>Reply:<br />
    The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 30436.  There is nothing wrong with that, <br />
    but this is larger than 1024, and could in certain setups cause problems with:<br />
    1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO) <br />
    2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs (e.g., DOD FDISK, OS/2 FDISK) </p>

Partition table entries are not in disk order <br /><br />

That can't be right..... <br />

Starting again (didn't save changes) <br />

Rewriting sector... <br />
placed First sector as 77824 instead... <br />

Last sector or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (77824-62333951, default 62333951): 62333951 <br /><br />

I'm going to max it out. <br /><br />

That might be a bit much for a minimalist OS, but we'll see. <br />
I'm gonna go ahead and write this... <br />

The partition table has been altered. <br />
Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table <br />
fdisk: WARNING: rereading partition table failed, kernel still uses old table: Device or resource busy <br /><br />

I'm gonna look up what ioctl() is. <br />

Quote from a Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioctl <br />

"In computing, ioctl (an abbreviation of input/output control) is a system call for device-specific <br />
input/output operations and other operations which cannot be expressed by regular system calls. <br />
It takes a parameter specifying a request code; the effect of a call depends completely on the <br />
request code. Request codes are often device-specific. For instance, a CD-ROM device driver which <br />
can instruct a physical device to eject a disc would provide an ioctl request code to do that. <br />
Device-independent request codes are sometimes used to give userspace access to kernel functions <br />
which are only used by core system software or still under development." <br /><br />

The ioctl system call first appeared in Version 7 of Unix under that name. It is supported by most <br />
Unix and Unix-like systems, including Linux and Mac OS X, though the available request codes differ <br />
from system to system. Microsoft Windows provides a similar function, named "DeviceIoControl", <br />
in its Win32 API. <br /><br />

So apparently, Input/Output control is the computer's way of telling connected devices what to <br />
do. I'm guessing this meant that whatever dwelt inside the OS image tried to read the partition <br />
table but couldn't, and told me that the kernel still uses the old table.  This is likely why step <br />
3 told me that Kernel needed to be aware of changes.  But how do I do this, if I even need to at all?? <br /><br />

I'm going to go ahead and reboot this command-line computer and see if anything changes. <br />
command: sudo reboot <br /><br />

Step 4 of the README says to expand the file system to the new partition boundaries with typing a <br />
certain command as root: <br /><br />

REFERENCE: How to become root in Linux <br />
<a href:"https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001639.htm">https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001639.htm</a><br />

command: su <br />
Reply:  Password: <br /><br />

Um, I don't know??  The README says under Login, passwords: "In case of piCore-x.y password for tc user is <br />

piCore <br />

It is not possible to log in as root." <br /><br />

Well then... <br />
(presses Enter key) <br /><br />

Reply: su: incorrect password <br /><br />

Guess I'll have to do step 4 with the sudo command: <br /><br />

Command: sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2 <br />
Reply: <br />
resize2fs 1.43.4 (31-Jan-2017) <br />
Filesystem at /dev/mmcblk0p2 is mounted on /mnt/mmcblk0p2; on-line resizing required <br />
old_desc_blocks = 1, new_desc_blocks = 238 <br />
The filesystem on /dev/mmcblk0p2 is now 31128064 (1k) blocks long. <br /><br />


It appears to have worked.  Now, according to the README, I am ready to use the bigger partition. <br />

Partitioning complete--I'm going to go ahead and reboot and see if this does anything different. <br /><br />

Rebooted to see the command line once more. <br />

The README states under Boot codes that some boot codes are specified in the /mnt/mmcblk0p1/cmdline.txt file. <br />
Maybe one of those will lead me to a GUI interface?? <br />
<a href:"http://tinycorelinux.net/faq.html#req">http://tinycorelinux.net/faq.html#req</a><br />
This link provides what appears to be settings for adjusting the boot protocols when at the boot <br />
prompt before the system boots.  I will guess that, given that I'm running this on an RPi, I will <br />
have to press their relevant function keys [F2], [F3], [F4] either on the rainbow screen or on <br />
the raspberries screen before they turn into command-line ASCII text. <br /><br />

Command: sudo reboot <br />
Presses F2 and F3 and F4 on the raspberries screen <br />
(Does nothing.) <br /><br />

Am I supposed to hold them down?? <br />
Command: sudo reboot <br />
Holds F2 and F3 and F4 on the raspberries screen <br />
(nothing.) <br /><br />

Research break!! <br />
<a href:"https://www.zdnet.com/article/hands-on-with-picore-7-0-tiny-core-linux-for-the-raspberry-pi/">https://www.zdnet.com/article/hands-on-with-picore-7-0-tiny-core-linux-for-the-raspberry-pi/</a><br />

According to this article, I have to add the GUI package myself (shoot) and that the initial image <br />
only supports a wired network connection--if I want to use wireless networking, I'll have to add the <br />
necessary extensions for a wireless adapter.<br /><br />

Regardless, to install the GUI package I have to put in this command: <br />

tce-load -iw TC <br />

This instruction uses a tce-load utility to install a TC.tcz extension.  I'll give it a try. <br /><br />

Reply (instantly, wow): <br />
Downloading: TC.tcz <br />
wget: bad address 'repo.tinycorelinux.net' <br />
md5sum: TC.tcz.md5.txt: No such file or directory <br />
Error on TC.tcz <br /><br />

I think this means I need to wire to the wall in order to get the GUI. </p>
  
<h3>14 February 2019 - happy Antivalentine's Day</h3>

<p>Arrived just before noon - constructions set up, RJ-45 into the wall.  I will attempt to <br />
procure the GUI package now. <br /><br />

Command: tce-load -iw TC <br />
Reply: <br />
(a whole list of packages with OK appearing next to them...) <br />
(Downloading each; connecting to repo.tinycorelinux.net to procure each.) <br /><br />

(This line appeared among some of the downloads:) <br />
/usr/bin/tce-load: line 273: desktop.sh: not found <br /><br />

Regardless: according to the article I found last time (zdnet): <br />
"Note that the extension name is upper-case, and this command is case-sensitive. The -iw options <br />
tell tce-load to download and install this extension, and to put it in the OnBoot list so that <br />
it will automatically be available in the future. After this command finishes, you can start the <br />
GUI with startx, or you can just reboot the Pi and it will come up with the GUI running." <br /><br />

Command: startx <br />
Reply: first a black screen, then the GUI appears!  Hallelujah! <br />
What's better: I should no longer have to deal with command lines on this OS unless I use the <br />
terminal. <br /><br />

Unit II: Teaching oneself to use Tiny Core Linux (piCore)<br />

First glance: <br />
I see a cyan/blue gradient background with the Tiny Core Linux logo in the middle.  On the bottom <br />
is a dock reminiscent of the Macintosh line of desktop OSes.  On this dock are eight icons, in <br />
order: Exit, Editor, Control Panel, Apps, RunProgram, MountTool, Terminal, and mc.  Upon clicking <br />
each to try to open them, only the Terminal and mc (which appears to be a file explorer) open up. <br /><br />

Clicking and right clicking on the background brings up a drop-down main menu with the following <br />
options:  the <strong>desktops</strong> you have available (which lead into drop down menus with applications <br />
active on these desktops or the option to close the desktop if no apps are active), a drop-down <br />
menu labeled <strong>Sticky</strong> which only appears when multiple desktops are open (no idea what this does), <br />
any applications you have open (this sets focus on these apps, much like clicking inside an inactive <br />
app to focus on it), <strong>Applications, System Tools, New Desktop, and Exit.</strong><br /><br />

The <strong>Applications</strong> option opens into a drop down menu with the following choices: mc and Terminal. <br />
These were the only docked applications I could open. <br /><br />

The <strong>System Tools</strong> menu opens into a drop down menu with twelve options: <em>Apps, ControlPanel, Editor, <br />
  Exit, MountTool, RunProgram, ScreenShot, Services, SetTime, tc-wbarconf, Top, and Xkill.</em><br />
<ul>
  <li><em>Apps</em> doesn't seem to do anything.
  <li><em>ControlPanel</em> doesn't seem to do anything.
  <li><em>Editor</em> doesn't seem to do anything.
  <li><em>Exit</em> doesn't seem to do anything.
  <li><em>MountTool</em> doesn't seem to do anything--but maybe, based off the name, I would need to <br />
    mount a USB in order to use this.  I'll try this out later.
  <li><em>RunProgram</em> doesn't seem to do anything.
  <li><em>ScreenShot</em> causes the cursor to blink once about a second after clicking.  This feedback <br />
    most likely is an indicator of this tool's functionality.
  <li><em>Services</em> doesn't seem to do anything.
  <li><em>SetTime</em> doesn't seem to do anything.  There isn't even a clock on the desktop.
  <li><em>tc-wbarconf</em> doesn't seem to do anything.  The name doesn't suggest anything familiar.
  <li><em>Top</em> opens what appears to be a list of running processes (task manager???)
  <li><em>Xkill</em> turns the cursor into a skull-and-crossbones.  Clicking the on the background in <br />
    this state does nothing and reverts to the regular cursor.  Clicking on an application in this state <br />
    closes it and reverts to the regular cursor.  Therefore, Xkill works as a force-stop tool.
</ul><br />

The <strong>New Desktop</strong> option generates an extra desktop to work in, adding the Desktop and Sticky options <br />
  to the main menu if they are not already present.<br /><br />
  
<strong>Exit</strong>, like the similar option under <strong>System Tools</strong> doesn't seem to do anything.<br />
At this rate, I'll have to use the terminal and the sudo prefix to reboot or power off the computer.<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.tinycorelinux.net/book.html">http://www.tinycorelinux.net/book.html</a><br />
This link presents the option of downloading a PDF called "Into the Core: a look at Tiny Core Linux". <br />
The README also referred to this book as being a valuable source for learning the basics of this <br />
operating system.  I'm going to go ahead and download the PDF and continue from there.<br /><br />

Excerpt from the article on ZDnet, retrieved 31st of last month:<br />
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hands-on-with-picore-7-0-tiny-core-linux-for-the-raspberry-pi/">https://www.zdnet.com/article/hands-on-with-picore-7-0-tiny-core-linux-for-the-raspberry-pi/</a><br />
"piCore is certainly not for everyone -- but then again neither is Tiny Core, or any of the other <br />
Core distributions, for that matter. piCore is intended for intermediate to advanced Linux users <br />
who want a solid base on which to build their own system, making it exactly what they want." <br /><br />

Okay.  I'm not entirely sure what packages I might be missing from the TC download/install, nor <br />
what I need to do to track down these missing packages, but I do feel as if I've got a solid <br />
footing here.  I will put this project on hold for right now, and use my second microSD card to <br />
load another Debian-based Linux distro, Raspbian, for another project that the Professor just <br />
revealed.</p>

<h3>18 February 2019</h3>  

<p>Loaded Raspbian OS (Full) on a second SD card.</p><br />
(Aside from the regular version of Raspbian, NOOBS Lite has Raspbian Full and Raspbian Mini, <br />
  along with a whole bunch of other images to install.)</p><br />

NOOBS for Raspberry Pi - <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/</a>
  
<h3>21 February 2018 (Tiny Core)</h3>
  
<p>I'm going to see if I can procure the packages that went missing when I downloaded the TC <br />
package that contained the UI, by installing the package again.  If it screws up the system, oh well. <br /><br /> It shouldn't duplicate what I already have.

Command in Terminal:<br />
tce-load -iw TC<br />
Response:<br />
TC is already installed!<br /><br />

Okay then.<br />
Shutting off (Exit still doesn't do anything!!)</p>
  
<h3>21 February 2018 (Raspbian)</h3>

<p>Doing a lot of the same stuff I did in CMST 250 last semester.<br /><br />

Used GUI to style up Raspbian to my liking--changed the background, changed the appearance of <br />
menu bar, changed system text font, changed icon set. <br /><br />

Used command line to install xscreensaver <br />
Used command line to install firefox-esp  --then purged (remove), it was horribly out of date. <br />
Used sudo apt autoremove to remove unneeded files. <br />
Used command line to install apache2  [Apache HTTP Web Server] and its suggested packages <br />
---then purged (for practice.)</p>
  
<h3>28 February 2018 (Raspbian)</h3>

<p>ToDo:</p>
<ul>
 <li> Set a static IP address on my Pi.
 <li> Install the Apache web server package.
</ul><br />
  
Used command line to get Apache HTTP Web Server (again)<br />
sudo apt-get install apache2 <br /><br />

Note: The device needs an internet connection in order to program a static IP address. <br />
As I don't intend to make my Pi (or at the very least, my microSD card) into a full-time web <br />
server outside of this class, I won't do this. <br /><br />

<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/security.md">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/security.md</a><br />
I read this documentation page on the Raspberry Pi website about securing the Pi, and knowing <br />
that I'll be using apache2 for its web server properties, this will definitely come in handy.</p><br />
  
Added user wre and assigned a password to it (when prompted). <br />
sudo adduser wre <br /><br />

Response: <br />
Adding user `wre' ... <br />
Adding new group `wre' (1001) ... <br />
Adding new user `wre' (1001) with group `wre' ... <br />
Creating home directory `home/wre' ... <br />
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ... <br />
Enter new UNIX password: <br /><br />

You can't have uppercase letters in your username. <br />
The password will be hidden when you type--be careful. <br /><br />

Made sudo require a password--better safe than sorry. <br />
Gave my new account wre sudo permissions. <br />
sudo adduser wre sudo <br /><br />

Attempted--and failed--to install Uncomplicated Fire Wall (ufw) and configure Fail2Ban <br />
(fail2ban) via command line.  The former returned a failure to fetch packages from the <br />
repositories and the latter was not configured--I attempted to manually copy the jail configuration <br /> 
file to jail.local.  Uninstalled.  I'll try again next time. </p>

<h3>21 Mar 2019 (Raspbian)</h3>

<p>Back from a sick day and spring break and I'm ready to continue my work. <br /><br />

[Some command line practice...] <br />
Installed GNU Image Manipulation Program (gimp-2.8.18-1+deb9u1) <br />
Command in terminal: sudo apt-get install gimp  <br />
Hmm...didn't appear as opened/received in the Add/Remove Software--installation failure???. <br />
Deleting, and installing through the GUI-based Add/Remove Software. <br /><br />

There it is!!! <br /><br />

[Now to try to do what I intended to do last time but couldn't...] <br />
Reference page: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/security.md">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/security.md</a><br /><br />

Trying again with fail2ban... <br />
sudo apt-get install fail2ban <br /><br />

Got it, and followed instructions on the webpage exactly. Apparently I was going about enabling <br />
the firewall all wrong the last time.  You have to use command line to copy (sudo cp) the <br />
jail.conf file into jail.local<br /><br />

Trying again with Uncomplicated Fire Wall... <br />
sudo apt-get install ufw <br />
Seemed to install perfectly fine this time. <br /><br />

Enabling the firewall to ensure it starts on boot... <br />
sudo ufw enable <br />
Response: Firewall is active and enabled on system startup <br /><br />

[Professor reveals course plans for the rest of the semester] <br />
[We built a network using the wall sockets in the laboratory, and were able to have our Pi's <br />
ping each other--view our apache2 web pages, which at that point was the default index.html <br />
file] <br /><br />

I'm having issues modifying my index.html page in /var/www/html/index.html  <br />
Apparently I'm running into permissions issues: <br />
Error message when trying to save a modified page: Can't open file to write <br /><br />

I'll try from the pi account. <br />
Same error!!! <br /><br />

Looks like I'll try to use this app as a superuser. <br />
Command in terminal: sudo leafpad %f <br />
Now I'm able to edit and save the index page.  Odd. <br />
Trying again, accessing from GUI, without the super-user privileges. <br />
Once again, I'm unable to edit.  The more you know...</p>
  
<h3>28 Mar 2019 (Raspbian)</h3>

<p>I'm going to edit my Apache2 pages to archive my projects from CMST 247.  This is one of the <br /> 
goals for this studio course. <br /><br />

Attempting to create directory 'projects' in /var/www/html/ <br />
Permission denied.  ????? <br /><br />

Found web page: <br />
<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/767504/permissions-problems-with-var-www-html-and-my-own-home-directory-for-a-website">https://askubuntu.com/questions/767504/permissions-problems-with-var-www-html-and-my-own-home-directory-for-a-website</a><br /><br />

Despite my computer being Raspbian and not Ubuntu, I'll try this. <br /><br />

In terminal: <br />
sudo cp -r /home/wre/Desktop/projects/ /var/www/html/ <br /><br />

It copied the entire projects folder, contents and all.  That's exactly what I was planning to do. <br /><br />

Now to load leafpad (as sudo) and edit my stuff! <br /><br />

An edit to /var/www/html/index.html later and I've got the basis of a website which I had to make.  <br />
Happy as a clam--I then made an external CSS file for the index page. </p>

<h3>4 Apr 2019 (Raspbian)</h3>

<p>Website update - added Project 4 - Loan Amortization Calculator and IRA Calculator. <br />
Edited HTML and CSS on main project page. <br /><br />

The time and date have been wrong for several weeks. <br />
Reading the Debian Reference leads me to a 'Managing Accurate Date and Time' which recommends <br />
a package called 'chrony', which comprises a background process (a.k.a. daemon) chronyd, and a <br />
command-line user interface chronyc.  I'm going to put it on and try to make it work. <br /><br />

sudo apt-get install chrony <br />
sudo chronyc <br /><br />

This link helped with commands: <br />
<a href="https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/doc/3.4/chronyc.html">https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/doc/3.4/chronyc.html</a></p>

<h3>11 Apr 2019 (Raspbian)</h3>

<p>Updated the website - added Project 5 - loantable.html and iratable.html <br /><br />

Removed Minecraft Pi edition and its related packages (and two Python packages related to <br />
Minecraft Pi) because it will not open.  No use in having a program take up space if it will <br />
not function. </p>

<h3>18 Apr 2019 (Raspbian)</h3>

<p>Today I learned a new UNIX command:<br /><br />

sudo -i<br /><br />

It allows you to put in your commands as the root user--you don't have to type 'sudo' before your commands.</p>

<h3>25 Apr 2019 (Raspbian)</h3>

<p>Updated portfolio to include my project from CMST 135 and lab reports from CMST 250 and <br />
  CMST 315.</p>
