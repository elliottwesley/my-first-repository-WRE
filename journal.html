  <h1>piJournal</h1>
  <p>This webpage is a journal for chronicling my exploration of the Raspberry Pi.</p>
  <h3>31 January (in class)</h3>
  <p>Assignment revealed.  We were to load an operating system on a Raspberry Pi computer and begin to explore its capabilities. <br>
  As I have already had experence from last semester, I wanted to seek out a different OS from the two I've already used: Raspbian,<br>
  a Debian-based OS designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi, and ubuntuMATE, version 16.04 (Xenial Xerus), optimized and ported <br>
  for use on a Raspberry Pi computer.  After a quick search on Distro Watch, I selected Tiny Core Linux to be my next OS to explore.<br>
  According to its entry on Distro Watch, it is 12 megabytes in size and based on Damn Small Linux (DSL), another ultra-lightweight <br>
  Linux OS that was developed over a decade ago and has long since been discontinued. <br>
  We were recommended to procure our own microSD cards.</p>
  <h3>4 February</h3>
  <p>I loaded Tiny Core (specifically piCore) onto my microSD and began to tinker with it.  Booting takes the user to a command-line <br>
  interface awaiting typed commands.  The README from the Tiny Core website provides instructions for what to do, but to me it felt <br>
  as if I was learning command-line all over again.  This fact alone tells me that Tiny Core would not be an ideal first choice for <br>
  someone who has never used a Linux operating system before, let alone command-line.  I will attempt to rewrite partitions on the <br>
  card again next class in hopes of creating a fully functional computer.</p>
