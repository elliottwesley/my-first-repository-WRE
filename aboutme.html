    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I've had an interest in computer applications since elementary school, and since then I've always wanted to turn that interest into a career.  In particular, the programming aspect of computers has really caught my eye. I like to explore the possibilities and limitations of code, designing simple (and much less simple) applications and games.</p>
    <p>As of May 2022, I am a graduate of Kansas State University Salina.  Bachelor of Science in Engineering - Computer Systems.</p>
