    <h2>Web of Color</h2>
      <p>This was the final project for my Web Fundamentals (Fall 2018) class.  The objective was to construct a functional website with HTML and CSS, comprising an index page, several other pages, and a contact page.  The PHP to which the contact page would post was provided (and reused from a previous assignment).  With exception of the screenshot of the Windows color picker, I designed the images using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
      <p>The website itself is an explanation of the RGB color system used in electronic-based visual media, followed by a series of five color gamuts, each increasing in size, and a contact page with a form.</p>
      <h3>SKILLS LEARNED/PRACTICED</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Technical ability:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Web technologies</li>
          <li>Digital media</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>TOOLS USED</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Caret (text and code editor)</li>
        <li>Adobe Illustrator (image and graphics editor)</li>
        <li>Web browsers:
        <ul>
          <li>Google Chrome</li>
          <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>DESIGN CHOICES</h3>
      <p>I chose a green color scheme for the site because I thought it to be less vivid than other colors.  In desktop view, I put the navigation bar on the right side to encourage viewers to look at the main content of the page first, as people typically read from left to right.  The fonts used on the page, with exception of the header, are sans-serif and comfortable to read.</p>
      <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
      <p>The greatest challenge for this project was getting the website to appear as I wanted it to appear, down to positioning of elements and what little can be done with CSS regarding how any given element behaves.  These were about specific features of the site, namely the sub-menu in the <i>Analysis</i> section of the navigation bar.  I also wanted to have the images centered in their respective pages, but I ultimately didn't get to do this.</p>
