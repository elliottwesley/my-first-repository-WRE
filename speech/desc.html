    <h2>Speech Web Collaboration</h2>
      <p>This project was for the Web Development Project class.  Conceptually it was the same as the <a href="../twist/desc.html">TWIST</a> project except the object here was to create a functioning website with a database for an actual client.  Said client was the Communication Sciences and Disorders department of Kansas State University in Manhattan.</p>
      <p>The client needed a site to aid in administering training to correct speech impediments, particularly those of the letter 'r', and to produce reports of patient progress.  The project was to include a database with patients, clinicians, and flashcards used in the training sessions.  The site would be made up of a login/logout system, a session and scoring system, the ability to add, edit and remove patients and clinicians from the database, and the ability to generate reports of patient progress.</p>
      <p>Around halfway through this project, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the college campus to close and thus my group and I had to work from our homes.  Thankfully, we made use of the remote meeting software Zoom to have regular meetings and work on the assignment together in real time.</p>

        </ul>
        <li>Application ability:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Analysis and design</li>
          <li>Implementation and testing</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Verbal and presentative communication</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Remote communication</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Teamwork and project management</li>
        <li>Professional and ethical knowledge</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>TOOLS USED</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Command-line interface</li>
        <li>Node.js (environment)</li>
        <li>Notepad++ (code editor)</li>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox (web browser)</li>
        <li>Git/GitHub</li>
        <li>Zoom (remote meeting software)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>CONTRIBUTIONS</h3>
      <p>In the pre-development stage, I assisted with use cases and the creation of the word list for the flashcards in our project.  In development, I assisted mainly with the page views and a few of the controller functions.</p>
      <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The occasional error or crash from mistyped code</li>
        <li>Staying focused--especially outside of our usual working environment</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>WHERE TO FROM HERE?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-world projects such as this one will provide me with valuable experience that translates well to other projects of its kind.  Additionally, our demonstration of adaptability by using Zoom to have regular meetings shows that we can handle outside events that interfere with assignments such as this one.</li>
