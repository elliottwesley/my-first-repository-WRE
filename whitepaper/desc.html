    <h2>Wicked Problem</h2>
      <p>This was the final project for my Technical Writing class.  The end goal was to write a white paper (report) and create a research poster about a "wicked problem" of my choosing.  A "wicked problem" is defined as a problem for which there might never be a solution.  I chose online privacy as the topic for my work as it is related to my field of interest, computer systems, and is the source of many people's worries in the digital era.  The report was to be written in APA format and the poster designed to be easily read from a distance.  Additionally, I was encouraged to follow the recommendations of Plain Language when creating both of these.  Plain Language is a system that avoids technical terms whenever possible, definitions when said terms cannot be avoided, graphics, lists and headings to make information easier to read and more accessible to the general public.</p>
      <h3>SKILLS LEARNED/PRACTICED</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Technical ability:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Graphic design</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Verbal and presentative communication</li>
        <li>Professional and ethical knowledge</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>TOOLS USED</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Google Docs (word processor)</li>
        <li>LibreOffice Draw (graphics editor)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>DESIGN CHOICES (POSTER)</h3>
      <p>I designed my poster to be reminiscent of the "Big Brother is watching you" posters from the George Orwell novel <em>1984</em>.  Data is gathered about the Web's users every hour as if said users are being watched, much like the members of the Party in <em>1984</em>. Thus the color scheme (and a subheading, to make the allusion more obvious) would fit perfectly with the subject matter of my poster.</p>

    <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Shortening sentences; I have a habit of using long sentences when I write</li>
      <li>Switching out higher-level words for more commonly understood words; dumbing down what I write</li>
      <li>Focus--I've always found writing papers to be tedious work</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>WHERE TO FROM HERE?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Even though writing essays is not my favorite thing to do, I know that the ability to write fluently and concisely is valuable in highly technical fields such as computer systems.  With practice, I could compose other informational displays that are simple to understand without throwing out advanced technical facts.</li>
