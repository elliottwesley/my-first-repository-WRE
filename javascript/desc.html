    <h2>Freetime JS Projects</h2>
      <p>These are projects/experiments written in JavaScript.  The purpose of these creations, aside from filling my free time and being evidence of me enjoying Web design, is to investigate the capabilities of JavaScript in realizing ideas for programs and games.  Each of these projects includes use of random-number-generation to determine outputs.  The first project, a truth-table generator, is predominantly based on using Document Object Model to manipulate the elements of a web page.  The second project, a math-drill generator, is an investigation of the complexity required to gamify something mundane, such as a multiple-choice quiz.  The third project is an implementation of the dual N-back memory test, done partly to show off, and partly because I believed it to be a more complicated task to implement (which it was).</p>
      <h3>SKILLS LEARNED/FOCUSED</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Technical ability:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Web technologies</li>
          <li>Digital media</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Application ability:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Analysis and design</li>
          <li>Implementation and testing</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Lifelong learning</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>TOOLS USED</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Caret (text and code editor)</li>
        <li>Google Chrome (web browser)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>DESIGN CHOICES</h3>
      <p>I deliberately centered the content in each project to make it the focal point of each page.  In the math drill and N-back pages, I also included monochromatic color schemes to make them more comfortable for viewing as opposed to black text on a white background.</p>
      <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
      <p>The main challenge in each of these exercises is figuring out just how to make the written programs do what I want them to do.  An example from the math drill program is implementing the multiple-choice answer system.  This ultimately required a random number generator to pick which box holds the correct answer, and then using the generator to create the numbers in the problems to also create the contents of the wrong answer boxes without copying any numbers in the other boxes.  This required a few extra variables.</p>
