    <h2>TWIST Web Collaboration</h2>
      <p>This was the final project for my Programming II and Computer Systems Studio III (Fall 2019) classes.  The objective was, in a team of five developers, to build a website according to the requirements of a theoretical client.  Our plan for the site included an index page and registration form accessible to any visitors, as well as an administrative section only accessible by the administrator, who has a username and password.  Inside this section, the administrator could view registrants and arrange schedules based on the registrants' choices.  The information on registrants and schedules would be kept in a MongoDB database.</p>
      <p>This exercise was a warm-up for the Web Development Project done in the next semester.  The goal of this project, from the instructor's perspective, was to observe our adaptability and how we worked as a time against a scenario that (as my group found out at the end of the project) was intentionally infeasible to complete.  This was both because of our collective inexperience at the time and because of the short time frame we had to complete the project (1 1/2 months).  As such, the functionality of our work is limited and incomplete.</p>
      <p>To our surprise, we were told that we handled this scenario considerably better than past students.</p>
      <h3>SKILLS LEARNED/PRACTICED</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Technical ability:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Web technologies</li>
          <li>Database management</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Application ability:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Analysis and design</li>
          <li>Implementation and testing</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Verbal and presentative communication</li>
        <li>Teamwork and project management</li>
        <li>Professional and ethical knowledge</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>TOOLS USED</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Command-line interface</li>
        <li>Node.js (environment)</li>
        <li>Notepad++ (code editor)</li>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox (web browser)</li>
        <li>Git/GitHub</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>CONTRIBUTIONS</h3>
      <p>I focused primarily on the database component of our project, which included the models that the objects in said database would adhere to.  I also deployed our project as a Heroku application.</p>
      <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
      <p>As this was our first real-world project, though an emulation of one, we inevitably ran into problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Numerous errors and crashes, often from mistyped code</li>
        <li>Lost time from doing some steps out of order (development life cycle)</li>
        <li>Inability to communicate with one another to avoid other problems</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>WHERE TO FROM HERE?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The learning experience this exercise provided was a great help for our <a href="../speech/desc.html">Web Development Project</a>, which was exactly the same as this project with the exception of having a real client with real needs, and several months to complete the necessary tasks.</li>
      </ul>
