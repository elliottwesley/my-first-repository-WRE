    <h2>Speech Web Collaboration</h2>
      <p>This project was for the Web Development Project class.  Conceptually it was the same as the <a href="../twist/desc.html">TWIST</a> project except the object here was to create a functioning website with a database for an actual client.  Said client was the CSD department of Kansas State University in Manhattan.</p>
      <p>The client needed a site to aid in administering training to correct speech impediments, particularly those of the letter 'r', and to produce reports of patient progress.  The project was to include a database with patients, clinicians, and flashcards used in the training sessions.  The site would be made up of a login/logout system, a session and scoring system, the ability to add, edit and remove patients and clinicians from the database, and the ability to generate reports of patient progress.</p>
