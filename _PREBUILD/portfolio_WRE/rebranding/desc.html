    <h2>Rebranding and Web Banner Ads</h2>
      <p>This was the final project for my Fundamentals of Visual Literacy (Fall 2019) class.  The objective was to redesign a well-known company's website and create web banners (advertisements) of predetermined sizes.  I chose to rebrand Coca-Cola. The website redesign was done in HTML and CSS, and the web banners are simple images.</p>
      <h3>SKILLS LEARNED/FOCUSED</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Technical ability:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Web technologies</li>
          <li>Digital media</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>TOOLS USED</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Caret (text and code editor)</li>
        <li>LibreOffice Draw (image and flowchart editor)</li>
        <li>GIMP (image editor)</li>
        <li>Google Chrome (web browser)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>DESIGN CHOICES</h3>
      <p>The website redesign is supposed to resemble a full bottle of Coca-Cola with the color scheme of off-black, red and white.  For the web-banners, I used the red-and-white color scheme similar to the printed label on a bottle of the well-known beverage.</p>
      <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
      <p>The primary challenge in this project was learning to use GIMP.  GIMP is very similar to Adobe Photoshop, except some of its features are different along with the interface.  At one point my experimentation with the color settings caused an image in the editor to be locked into a hideous olive-green color scheme.</p>
      <h3>WHERE TO FROM HERE?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Using LibreOffice Draw to create detailed wireframes of site concepts</li>
        <li>Using GIMP to create and edit logos/images for websites</li>
      </ul>
